# Officer Role Quiz

### What I learnt
- I first used if statements to help determine the role that should be given to user once the quiz is completed but this was bad practice as code was repeated. Therefore I used the find() method to efficiently determine the user’s final result. This approach is much simpler than relying on multiple if statements, which was less efficient.

- I used a point system to help with user results. To ensure that users received the correct role based on their answers and accumulated points, I researched methods for accurate scoring. I then implemented a threshold system, each role has a predefined threshold, and find() returns the first role whose threshold is met or exceeded by the user’s total points. This ensures that each result is unique and tailored to the individual user.

### Future Improvements
- Once the user has completed their quiz and is given their suited societies category such as Sport, general insert etc, the tool could then calculate the users answers and give the percentage of how likely it matches to the users personality.
